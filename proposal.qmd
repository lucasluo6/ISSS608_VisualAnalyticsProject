## EchoScope™: Leveraging Visual Analytics & Graph Intelligence to Explore Music Influence with Sailor Shift

---

### 1. Project Title

**EchoScope™ — A Visual Analytics Prototype for Music Influence Exploration**

---

### 2. Short Description

#### • Problem

The music industry lacks intuitive tools to visually trace influence, discover emerging talents, and understand genre diffusion. Existing dashboards are often statistical, but not exploratory or network-driven.

#### • Proposal

Using Mini-Challenge 1 (VAST 2025) data, we propose **EchoScope** — a visual analytics tool to explore Sailor Shift’s influence and the rise of Oceanus Folk through interactive visualizations built with Shiny and network graphs.

#### 📂 Case Data Sample

To build this system, we analyzed:

- **17,000+ nodes** representing artists, genres, producers, and songs  
- **37,000+ edges** including collaboration, stylistic influence, production, and genre classification  
- **Key fields**: `notoriety_date`, `notable`, `InStyleOf`, `PerformerOf`, `genre`

---

### 3. Motivation: Product Positioning

**EchoScope™** is a conceptual SaaS-like platform that combines:

- Music knowledge graphs  
- Genre diffusion analysis  
- Artist influence scoring  

It is designed to simulate a data product that helps:

- 🎧 Music platforms discover new talents  
- 🏷️ Labels map influence networks  
- 📊 Brands and analysts follow genre evolution  

> 🎯 **Vision**: Use visual analytics + graph intelligence to discover the next “Sailor Shift.”

---

### 4. Problem Statement

We treat Mini-Challenge 1 as a real-world business question:

> **How can we analyze the career of Sailor Shift and uncover the influence of Oceanus Folk?**

EchoScope addresses this through exploratory visual analytics features.
